    Clients should not be forced to implement interfaces they don't use.
    Instead of one large interface, split it into smaller, more specific ones.

    In this example, Robot should not be forced to implement eat() because
    it doesnâ€™t need to eat. The interface has been split into Workable and Eatable,
    adhering to the Interface Segregation Principle.
